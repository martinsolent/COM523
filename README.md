# UI COM523

### Why is this unit important?
User interface design plays an important role within the digital industries. Professional Interface designers work in multidisciplinary teams alongside user experience (UX) practitioners and web developers to create accessible user centred digital products and services for a wide range of applications. 

### What you will learn on the unit
You will learn current workflows for creating prototypes for digital products that solve a design problem by gathering requirements, creating design systems, building prototypes that will be tested and evaluated for usability.

As user interface (UI) designers work alongside UX and web development practitioners you will learn how UX informs your design prototypes and what format completed projects will be handed over to a web or software developer.

You will receive technical instruction on a range of current prototyping tools, platforms and processes 

### We will cover the following areas: 
•	Principles and theory for interaction design
•	Designing for multiple screen and device outputs
•	Working within current design standards and guidelines
•	Design patterns and systems
•	Creating accessible interfaces and interactions
•	Testing and evaluation
•	Design problem case studies
•	User interface (UI), Voice user interface (VUI), AR UI (Augmented Reality user interface)

### How you will learn
Learning activities will be based on real-world scenarios, preparing you for employment or career progression. 

The lecture will deliver the core principles of user interface design with the practical sessions offering you technical design instruction and studio practice. Practical sessions will consist of guided walk-throughs, independent and group tasks.

How much time the unit requires: This is a 20-credit unit, in fitting with the amount of credits, you will be expected to study for 200 hours in total. This total learning time is made up of lectures, practical sessions and self-initiated study. Your tutor will offer you guidance on how you should best manage your study time on this unit.

### How you will be assessed
Tasks which help you to learn and prepares you for summative tasks (Formative):
You will be given set milestones and informal feedback on your work before submitting your summative assessment for grading. You will be given opportunities to verbally present your design practice and research in preparation for assessment two (AE2). 

### Tasks which count towards your degree (Summative):
There are two summative assessment tasks in this unit, the first assessment (AE1) is an individual presentation of a design problem worth 20% of your final grade. The second assessment (AE2) worth 80% of your final grade, requiring you to create a design problem case study, based on the presentation you delivered for AE1, containing research, documentation of the design process and evaluation. 

You will need to gain evaluation from user testing and feedback from digital product practitioners to determine your objectives have been achieved and reflect constructively.
 
### When assessment does not go to plan
If you do not pass this unit, you will have to resubmit your work after improving it based on feedback from your tutor.
 
### What you will be able to do after the unit
On completion of this unit you will be able to create professional standard user interface clickable prototypes.

1.	Manage a digital project life cycle from brief through to delivery.

2.	Discuss and implement user interface prototypes using current guidelines for design, intellectual properties and accessibility.

3.	Analyse interface designs problems and suggest solutions to identify principles that underpin user experiences.

4.	Use research and technical skills to produce interface prototypes that are fit for purpose within the environment of professional workflows. 

5.	Confidently communicate ideas and gain feedback from practitioners, team members and clients with reference to relevant concepts and design principles.

6.	Communicate clearly using a range of appropriate sources
